     Modify the view in a closure. This can be useful when you need to conditionally apply a modifier that is unavailable on certain platforms.

     For example, imagine this code needing to run on macOS too where `View#actionSheet()` is not available:

     ```
     struct ContentView: View {
         var body: some View {
             Text("Unicorn")
                 .modify {
                     #if os(iOS)
                     $0.actionSheet(â€¦)
                     #else
                     $0
                     #endif
                 }
         }
     }
     ```
     */
    func modify<T: View>(@ViewBuilder modifier: (Self) -> T) -> T {
        modifier(self)
    }
